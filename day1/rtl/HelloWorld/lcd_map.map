  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          168
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            71 out of     168   42%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  12 out of     168    7%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          85 out of     168   50%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              19 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        25 out of     440    5%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
